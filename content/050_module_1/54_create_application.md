# Create the Application
In Armory Enterprise, an "Application" is basically a grouping of pipelines and the resources deployed by those pipelines. An Application can group any set of related resouces, and can group objects across multiple cloud targets (and cloud target types). Common ways to organize services are:

- One application for each microservice
- One application for a set of microservices that make up a single cohesive business function
- One application for each team

Let's create an application called "hello-today".

1. Log into the Armory Enterprise UI.
2. Click on "Applications"
3. Click on "Actions" and then "Create Application"
4. Call the application "hello-today" and put in your email address in the "Owner Email" field.
5. Click "Create"
