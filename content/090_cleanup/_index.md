# Workshop Cleanup

Congratulations on completing the workshop! Now although you may AWS credits to pay for the costs incurred today, the next few sections will instruct you how to turn off all the infrastructure you've created in order to work through the material.

Here is how to delete the Stacks provisioned by Cloudformation:

1. Go to your Cloudformation dashbord.
1. Scroll to the first stack that is located at the bottom of the the page and select it.
1. Press the Delete button.
1. This process may take up to 30 minutes for everything to be fully deleted.
1. Monitor the clean up by selecting the events button.
