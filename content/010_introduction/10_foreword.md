# State of the industry
## Why are organizations still striving to achieve continuous delivery?

Today’s world revolves around software and services working reliably and continuously – the internet is accessible 24 hours a day, and users expect 100% uptime. In fact, they are requiring it. In a recent PWC study measuring customer experience, they found that "one in three consumers say they will walk away from a brand they love after just one bad experience. This figure is even higher in Latin America, at 49%." With new start-ups disrupting even the most traditional of markets, this will only continue to grow.

With 70% of outages caused by updates, it's becoming clearer why achieving true continuous delivery - where you can deploy software in a safe and secure way at the speed your business needs - is a necessity for survival. With complex ever-changing environments, tools, and deploy targets how do you keep up? There are two choices: 1) continue to grow your team to develop, evolve, test, and support all the infrastructure you need or 2) invest in a tool that abstracts away much of the cloud configuration details, allowing your developers more time to focus on meaningful tasks instead of infrastructure details. With customer demands and expectations increasing, infrastructure changing and evolving, and the ability to keep up, it really feels like there is only one choice.

Imagine that the code you are trying to deliver is a car on a crowded road. You need to drop it off safely and make sure it is working at many stops along the way - from your Git to CI tools to the multiple end locations. Now imagine that every stopping place has different processes for parking - all very different. Not to mention the congestion of the other code that is trying to move along similar paths. And don't forget the construction or new routes that constantly pop up. It is no wonder that it can take weeks or even months for that code to complete its journey.

And what if you run into issues along the way?
