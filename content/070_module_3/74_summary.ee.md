## Summary
In this final module of the workshop, you've learned how to scale up and roll back a deployment: two important techniques for modern continuous delivery. B/G as well as Canary rollout methods are dependent on these two techniques. Although we leveraged Kubernetes for this lab, these techniques are applicable to whichever deployment target you may use.
