## Summary
In this final module of the workshop you learned about scale up and roll back, two important techniques for modern continuous delivery. Blue/Green as well as Canary rollouts depend on these features. We leveraged Kubernetes for this lab, but rollback and scale up, blue/green and canary are all important and 
applicable to whichever deployment target you may use. They are the cornerstone of modern continuous delivery.
